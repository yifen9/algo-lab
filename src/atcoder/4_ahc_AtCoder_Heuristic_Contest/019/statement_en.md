### **About AtCoder Heuristic Contest（AHC）**

<section>

<p>
This is a new series of programming contests that will be held regularly on AtCoder.
	Unlike algorithm contests such as ABC/ARC/AGC, the goal is to create a better solution to a problem for which it is difficult to find the optimal solution. For examples of problems, see <a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/archive?ratedType=0&category=1200&keyword=">past contests of similar format</a>.
      
</p>

<p>
AHC will have a new rating system that is different from the existing ABC/ARC/AGC rating system.
	Unlike the ABC/ARC/AGC ratings, AHC will use a rating system that does not decrease even if contest performance is poor. Please feel free to participate.
      
</p>

<p>
We are planning to hold a long-term contest with a duration of more than a week and a short-term contest with a duration of less than a day, alternately about once a month. We plan to use the same ratings for both the long and short contests, but we may need to use different ratings, or correct the rating formula, due to the possibility of a large bias in the number of participants. For this reason, the ratings will remain in beta for a while. Contest results during the beta period will be used in the official rating. However, due to changes in the rating formula, the rating may change when the official version is released.
