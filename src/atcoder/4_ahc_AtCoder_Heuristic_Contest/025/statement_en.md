### **About AtCoder Heuristic Contest（AHC）**

<section>

<p>
This is a series of programming contests held regularly on AtCoder.
                Unlike algorithm contests such as ABC/ARC/AGC, the goal is to create a better solution to a problem for
                which it is difficult to find the optimal solution. For examples of problems, see <a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/archive?ratedType=4&category=0&keyword=">past contests of
                    similar format</a>.
            
</p>

<p>
AHC has a new rating system that is different from the existing ABC/ARC/AGC rating system.
                Unlike the ABC/ARC/AGC ratings, AHC rating system we use is monotonically non-decreasing, which values the best performance rather than the average performance. Please feel free to participate.
