### **Story**

<p>
Nihonbashi Simulator is a turn-based simulation game where you manage railway company X in the fictional country R. As a big fan of this game, your goal is to make the company highly profitable. By appropriately constructing rails and stations, you will assist the people living in country R in their commuting while developing X into the best railway company!
</p>

### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Country R is composed of sections arranged in an $N \times N$grid. The section in the $i$-th row from the top $(0 \le i < N)$, and the $j$-th column from the left $(0 \le j < N)$is denoted as $(i,j)$.
                    Each section can be either empty, rail, or station:
                    
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Empty
                            
<ul>

<li>
Does not connect to other sections.
</li>

<li>
Can be changed to a station or rail by paying a cost.
</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>
Rail
                            
<ul>

<li>
Connects to a maximum of two adjacent non-empty sections on the up, down, left, and right. Rails are of six types, numbered as shown in the diagram below, depending on their connections.
</li>

<li>
Can be changed to a station by paying a cost.
</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>
Station
                        
<ul>

<li>
Connects to a maximum of four adjacent non-empty sections on the up, down, left, and right.
</li>

</ul>

<figurecaption>
Types of rails
</figurecaption>

</figure>

<p>

</p>

<p>
There are $M$people living in country R. The home of person $c$is located at section $(i_{c,s}, j_{c,s})$, and workplace is at section $(i_{c,t}, j_{c,t})$, between which he/she commutes.
                
</p>

<p>
At the start of the game, railway company X has money of $K$, and all sections are empty. The game will proceed for $T$turns.
</p>

### **How the game progresses**

<p>
Each turn consists of a construction phase followed by a collection phase.
</p>

#### **Construction phase**

<p>
During the construction phase, one of the following actions is performed: placing a rail, placing a station, or waiting. Actions that would result in money going below zero are not allowed.
                The check for whether money is below zero is performed before the collection phase.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Placing a rail: Select one empty section and change it to one of the six types of rails. Money decreases by 100.
</li>

<li>
Placing a station: Select one empty or rail section and change it to a station. Money decreases by 5000.
</li>

<li>
Waiting: The state of the sections and the money do not change.
</li>

</ul>

#### **Collection phase**

<p>
The people living in country R commute simultaneously. Person $c$will use train and pay a fare to railway company X only if there exist sections $(i_p, j_p)$and $(i_q, j_q)$that satisfy the following conditions:
                
</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>

<li>
Sections $(i_p, j_p), (i_q, j_q)$are stations.
</li>

<li>
It is possible to reach section $(i_q, j_q)$from section $(i_p, j_p)$via zero or more connected station or rail sections.
</li>

<li>
$| i_{c,s} - i_p| + | j_{c,s} - j_p| \leq 2$
</li>

<li>
$| i_{c,t} - i_q| + | j_{c,t} - j_q| \leq 2$
</li>

</ul>

<p>

</p>

<p>
When person $c$uses the train, railway company X's money increases by $|i_{c,s} - i_{c,t}| + |j_{c,s} - j_{c,t}|$.
</p>



<p>
Please determine the actions to maximize the money at the end of turn $T$.
</p>

</section>

</div>

<div>

<section>

### **Scoring**

<p>
For each test case, the absolute score is obtained as the value of the money at the end of $T$turns, and we compute the 
<font color="red">
<strong>
relative score
</strong>
</font>
$\mathrm{round}(10^9\times \frac{\mathrm{YOUR}}{\mathrm{MAX}})$, where YOUR is your absolute score and MAX is the maximum absolute score among all competitors obtained on that test case. The score of the submission is the sum of the relative scores.
                       In test cases where MAX is $0$, the relative score for all participants who received 
<span>
AC
</span>
will be $10^9$.
                    
</p>

<p>
If the following invalid outputs are produced, it will be judged as 
<span>
WA
</span>
ã€‚
                        
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Placing a rail into a station or rail section
</li>

<li>
Placing a station into a station section
</li>

<li>
An action that results in money being less than 0
</li>

<li>
Invalid action with incorrect rail types or section position
</li>

<li>
The number of actions output is not $T$
</li>

</ul>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The final ranking will be determined by the system test with more inputs which will be run after the contest is over.
                    In both the provisional/system test, if your submission produces illegal output or exceeds the time limit for some test cases, only the score for those test cases will be zero, and your submission will be excluded from the MAX calculation for those test cases.
</p>

<p>
The system test will be performed only for 
<font color="red">
<strong>
the last submission which received a result other than 
<span>
CE
</span>

</strong>
</font>
.
                    Be careful not to make a mistake in the final submission.
</p>

#### **Number of test cases**

<ul>

<li>
Provisional test: 50
                        
</li>

<li>
System test: 2000
                            
<ul>

<li>
We will publish <a href="https://img.atcoder.jp/ahc043/seeds.txt">seeds.txt</a>(sha256=`ed5b3f922dc3633bade3f70cc6f1dd1bb3087dba36ce26ce9d4888ce2ec7a247`) after the contest is over.
</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

#### **About Relative Evaluation System**

<p>
In both the provisional/system test, the standings will be calculated using only the last submission which received a result other than 
<span>
CE
</span>
.
                        Only the last submissions are used to calculate the MAX for each test case when calculating the relative scores.
                    
</p>

<p>
The scores shown in the standings are relative, and whenever a new submission arrives, all relative scores are recalculated.
                        On the other hand, the score for each submission shown on the submissions page is the sum of the absolute score for each test case, and the relative scores are not shown.
                        In order to know the relative score of submission other than the latest one in the current standings, you need to resubmit it.
                        If your submission produces illegal output or exceeds the time limit for some test cases, the score shown on the submissions page will be 0, but the standings show the sum of the relative scores for the test cases that were answered correctly.
                    
</p>

#### **About execution time**

<p>
Execution time may vary slightly from run to run.
                        In addition, since system tests simultaneously perform a large number of executions, it has been observed that execution time increases by several percent compared to provisional tests.
                        For these reasons, submissions that are very close to the time limit may result in 
<span>
TLE
</span>
in the system test.
                        Please measure the execution time in your program to terminate the process, or make sure to have enough time margin for the execution.

### **Input Generation**

<details>

<summary>
Details
</summary>

<p>
Let $\mathrm{rand}(L, U)$be a function that generates a uniform random integer between $L$and $U$, inclusive,
                                and $\mathrm{rand\_double}(L, U)$be a function that generates a uniform random real number greater than or equal to $L$and less than $U$, 
                                and $\mathrm{normal}(\mu,\sigma)$be a function that generates a random real number from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$and standard deviation $\sigma$.
                            
</p>

#### **Generation of $M$**

<p>
$M = \mathrm{round}(50 \times 2 ^{\mathrm{rand\_double}(0,5)})$
</p>

#### **Generation of the locations of homes and workplaces**

<p>
Create a Gaussian mixture model to generate home locations as follows:

Generate the number of clusters with $\mathrm{rand}(5,15)$.
                                For each cluster $i$, generate the weight $w_i = \mathrm{rand\_double}(0, 1)$, the center coordinates $(r_i, c_i) =  (\mathrm{rand\_double}(0, N-1), \mathrm{rand\_double}(0, N-1))$, and the standard deviation $\sigma_i  = \mathrm{rand\_double}(2, 15)$.
                                

Similarly, create a Gaussian mixture model to generate workplace locations.
                            
</p>

<p>
Repeat the following process $M$times to generate the locations for people's homes and workplaces:
                            
</p>

<p>

</p>

<ol>

<li>
Randomly select a cluster $i$from the Gaussian mixture model for generating home locations with a probability proportional to the weight $w_i$.
</li>

<li>
For the selected $i$, generate the home location as $r_0 = \text{round}(\text{normal}(r_i, \sigma_i)), c_0 =  \text{round}(\text{normal}(c_i, \sigma_i))$.
</li>

<li>
If the generated location $(r_0, c_0)$do not satisfy $0 \leq r_0 \lt N $or $0 \leq c_0 \lt N $, start over from step 1.
</li>

<li>
Similarly, generate the workplace location $(r_1, c_1) $.
</li>

<li>
If the Manhattan distance between the home location $(r_0, c_0)$and the workplace location $(r_1, c_1)$is less than or equal to $4$, start over from step 1.
</li>

</ol>

<p>

</p>

#### **Generation of $K$**

<p>
For $M$people, let the minimum Manhattan distance between their home and workplace locations be $d$.
                                $K$is generated as $\mathrm{rand}(\mathrm{max}(10, d) \times 100, 2 \times N \times 100) + 10000$.

<p>
The following processes are implemented:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Examine person $0$, $1$, $\ldots$in order to find the first person for whom it is possible to place stations at their home and workplace locations and connect them with rails at the initial money.
</li>

<li>
Place stations at the identified person's home and workplace locations, and place rails to connect from home to workplace.
</li>

<li>
After that, wait until turn $T$.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
The code includes a simulation of the changes in money. You may use it as a reference when creating your solution.
