## **Why is Recruit interested in AtCoder users?**

<section>

<p>
Recruit went through a big restructuring in 2021, integrating multiple companies into an organized whole. As a result, we now have a solid base of operational know-how and a diverse workforce. Our next goal is to make a social contribution by continuously improving our value proposition and creating value by innovation.
</p>

<p>
As a result of our integration, we now operate a variety of services across multiple industries and handle massive amounts of data. Our data specialists have a central role in developing Recruit's business and products, and we as a company are aiming to have competitive advantage by having best-in-class data specialists, data platforms and data products.
</p>
