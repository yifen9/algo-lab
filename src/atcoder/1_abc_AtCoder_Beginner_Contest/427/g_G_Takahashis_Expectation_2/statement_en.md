### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Takahashi will receive some presents from now on.
</p>

<p>
He has an integer parameter called mood, and the mood changes each time he receives a present.
Each present has an integer parameter called value $P$, and Takahashi's mood changes according to this parameter as follows:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
If the value $P$of the received present is greater than or equal to the mood value, he is delighted with the present, and the mood increases by $A$.
</li>

<li>
If the value $P$of the received present is less than the mood value, he is disappointed with the present, and the mood decreases by $B$.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Initially, there are $N$presents that Takahashi is scheduled to receive, and the value of the $i$-th present he will receive $(1\le i\le N)$is $P _ i$.
</p>

<p>
You are given $Q$queries consisting of two types: addition queries and question queries. Process all of them in order, and answer all question queries.
</p>

<p>
The $i$-th query is represented by two integers $T _ i,X _ i$, and it is an addition query if $T _ i=1$, and a question query if $T _ i=2$.
</p>

<p>
In an addition query, add a new present with value $X _ i$to the end of the presents to be received.
</p>

<p>
In a question query, answer the following question:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Find Takahashi's mood after receiving all the presents he is scheduled to receive when his mood is initially $X _ i$.
</p>

</blockquote>

</div>

<p>
Initially, the values of the presents Takahashi is scheduled to receive are $59,-26,53,58$, in the order he will receive them.
</p>

<p>
The five queries are as follows:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
When his mood is initially $9$, his mood changes as $9\rightarrow40\rightarrow-1\rightarrow30\rightarrow61$each time he receives a present, so print the final mood $61$.
</li>

<li>
A present with value $79$is added to the presents he is scheduled to receive, and the values of the presents he is scheduled to receive become $59,-26,53,58,79$.
</li>

<li>
When his mood is initially $32$, his mood changes as $32\rightarrow63\rightarrow22\rightarrow53\rightarrow84\rightarrow43$each time he receives a present, so print the final mood $43$.
</li>

<li>
A present with value $38$is added to the presents he is scheduled to receive, and the values of the presents he is scheduled to receive become $59,-26,53,58,79,38$.
</li>

<li>
When his mood is initially $462$, his mood changes as $462\rightarrow421\rightarrow380\rightarrow339\rightarrow298\rightarrow257\rightarrow216$each time he receives a present, so print the final mood $216$.
