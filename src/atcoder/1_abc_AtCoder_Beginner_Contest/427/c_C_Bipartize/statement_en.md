### **Problem Statement**

<p>
There is a simple undirected graph with $N$vertices and $M$edges.
The graph consists of vertex $1,$vertex $2,\ldots,$vertex $N$, and the $i$-th edge $(1\le i\le M)$connects vertices $u _ i$and $v _ i$.
</p>

<p>
You will perform the following operation zero or more times:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Choose one edge that has not been deleted yet, and delete it.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Your goal is to make the graph bipartite.
Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the graph after the operations bipartite.
</p>

<details>

<summary>
What it means for a graph to be simple?
</summary>

<p>
A graph is simple if and only if it has no self-loops (edges where $u _ i=v _ i$) or multi-edges (pairs of edges where $u _ i=u _ j$and $v _ i=v _ j$).
</p>

</details>

<details>

<summary>
What is a bipartite graph?
</summary>

<p>
A bipartite graph is a graph where it is possible to color each vertex black or white satisfying the following condition:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
For every edge, the two vertices connected by that edge have different colors.
</li>

</ul>

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

2

</div>

<p>
You can make the graph bipartite by deleting two edges: for example, the edge connecting vertices $1$and $3$, and the edge connecting vertices $3$and $5$.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to make the graph bipartite by performing one or less operations, so print `2`.

### **Sample Output 2**

<div>

0

</div>

<p>
The graph is bipartite from the beginning.
Thus, the number of operations that need to be performed is $0$.
