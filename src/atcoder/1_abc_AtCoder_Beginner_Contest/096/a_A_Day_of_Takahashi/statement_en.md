### **Problem Statement**

<p>
In AtCoder Kingdom, Gregorian calendar is used, and dates are written in the "year-month-day" order, or the "month-day" order without the year.

For example, May $3$, $2018$is written as $2018$-$5$-$3$, or $5$-$3$without the year.  
</p>

<p>
In this country, a date is called 
<em>
Takahashi
</em>
when the month and the day are equal as numbers. For example, $5$-$5$is Takahashi.

How many days from $2018$-$1$-$1$through $2018$-$a$-$b$are Takahashi?
