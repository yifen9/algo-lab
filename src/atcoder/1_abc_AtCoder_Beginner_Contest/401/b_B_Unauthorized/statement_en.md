### **Problem Statement**

<p>
One day, Takahashi performed $N$operations on a certain web site.
</p>

<p>
The $i$â€‘th operation $(1 \le i \le N)$is represented by a string $S_i$, which is one of the following:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
$S _ i=$`login`: He performs a login operation and becomes logged in to the site.
</li>

<li>
$S _ i=$`logout`: He performs a logout operation and becomes not logged in to the site.
</li>

<li>
$S _ i=$`public`: He accesses a public page of the site.
</li>

<li>
$S _ i=$`private`: He accesses a private page of the site.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
The site returns an 
<strong>
authentication error
</strong>
if and only if he accesses a private page while he is not logged in.
</p>

<p>
Logging in again while already logged in, or logging out again while already logged out, does 
<strong>
not
</strong>
cause an error. Even after an authentication error is returned, he continues performing the remaining operations.
</p>

<p>
Initially, he is not logged in.
</p>

<p>
Print the number of operations among the $N$operations at which he receives an authentication error.
</p>

</li>

</ul>

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

1

</div>

<p>
The result of each operation is as follows:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Takahashi becomes logged in.
</li>

<li>
He accesses a private page. He is logged in, so no error is returned.
</li>

<li>
He accesses a public page.
</li>

<li>
He becomes logged out.
</li>

<li>
He accesses a private page. He is not logged in, so an authentication error is returned.
</li>

<li>
He accesses a public page.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
An authentication error occurs only at the 5th operation, so print `1`.

<p>
If he tries to access private pages consecutively while not logged in, he receives an authentication error for each such operation.
</p>

<p>
Note that logging out again while already logged out does not cause an authentication error.
