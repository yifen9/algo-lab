### **Problem Statement**

<p>
There is an ultramarathon course totaling $100\;\mathrm{km}$.
Water stations are set up every $5\;\mathrm{km}$along the course, including the start and goal, for a total of $21$.
</p>

<p>
Takahashi is at the $N\;\mathrm{km}$point of this course.
Find the position of the nearest water station to him.
</p>

<p>
Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that the nearest water station is uniquely determined.

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

55

</div>

<p>
Takahashi is at the $53\;\mathrm{km}$point of the course.
The water station at the $55\;\mathrm{km}$point is $2\;\mathrm{km}$away, and there is no closer water station.
Therefore, you should print $55$.
