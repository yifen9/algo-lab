### **Contest Summary**

<section>

<p>
This is an online programming contest sponsored by <a href="https://corp.freee.co.jp/en/">freee, Inc.</a>
</p>

<p>
freee's mission is to 「Empower Small Businesses to Take Center Stage」 and we develop and provide services with
        the aim of building an "integrated management platform that allows anyone to run their business freely. We
        believe that small businesses, which can materialize their ideas boldly and with a sense of speed, can create
        various innovations and at the same time, stimulate large companies to create a new movement in the world as a
        whole.

### **Reason why freee needs AtCoder users**

<section>

<p>
freee is a cloud-based ERP that stores customer's Accounting, Human Resources, and other business data and
        provides functions to improve business efficiency.
      
</p>

<p>
Records of daily transactions, time and attendance, etc. gradually become large volumes of data as the company
        grows, and the calculation efficiency must be considered in order to tabulate and present this information in
        real time. Tax and salary calculations also require the ability to translate complex specifications of laws that
        change from year to year into logic and accurately put them into code. In addition, since the complexity of each
        domain area is divided into microservices and loosely coupled so as not to affect others, data must be
        efficiently federated while maintaining consistency among the services.
      
</p>

<p>
We believe that AtCoder users' 「ability to select the appropriate data structure and algorithm for the problem」
        and 「ability to implement quickly while considering edge cases」 will be of great help in these challenges. This
        time we are organizing a programming contest on AtCoder to meet AtCoder users who have such talent and to get
        them interested in freee.

### **freee's business content that can utilize the abilities cultivated at AtCoder**

<section>

<p>
This section describes an example of freee's business content that can utilize the implementation skills
        cultivated with AtCoder, knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and ability to estimate the amount of
        calculation.
      
</p>

<ul>

<li>
In the development of the common infrastructure, we are also developing microservices that handle tree
          structures such as the organizational hierarchy of a company.
        
</li>

<li>
Algorithms are used to structure real-world data, such as tracking changes in credit card statements over
          time or inferring transaction details from receipt images.
        
</li>

<li>
Various microservices have distributed system designs to maintain data integrity among other internal
          services.
        
</li>

<li>
In the development of infrastructure services, we are implementing libraries that provide common functions
          such as authentication and failover with only a small overhead.
        
</li>

<li>
At DBRE, we understand the internal implementation of each database from open source code and papers to
          determine optimal usage and deploy stable operations throughout the company.

### **About freee's competitive programming club**

<section>

<p>
freee launched the Competitive Programming Club in January 2022 as a club activity, and currently meets twice a
        week, mainly to discuss impressions and solutions to AtCoder contests held on Saturdays and Sundays. For more
        information, please see the <a href="https://developers.freee.co.jp/entry/Competitive_Programming_Club">article
          (Written in Japanese) about the club's activities.</a>In recent activities other than impression battles, we are expanding the range of activities every day, such as
        holding an in-house programming contest in which the members were in charge of asking questions.

### **Contest Rules**
This contest is full-feedback (solutions are judged during the contest).
    

When you solve a problem, you get a score assigned to it.
    Competitors are ranked first by total scores, then by penalties.
    The penalties are computed as (the time you spend to get your current score) + (5 minutes) * (the number of
    incorrect attempts).
