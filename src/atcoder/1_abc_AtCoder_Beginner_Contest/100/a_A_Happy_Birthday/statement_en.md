### **Problem Statement**

<p>
E869120's and square1001's $16$-th birthday is coming soon.

Takahashi from AtCoder Kingdom gave them a round cake cut into $16$equal fan-shaped pieces.
</p>

<p>
E869120 and square1001 were just about to eat $A$and $B$of those pieces, respectively,

when they found a note attached to the cake saying that "the same person should not take two adjacent pieces of cake".
</p>

<p>
Can both of them obey the instruction in the note and take desired numbers of pieces of cake?
