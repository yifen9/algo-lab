### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Today, the memorable AtCoder Beginner Contest 100 takes place. On this occasion, Takahashi would like to give an integer to Ringo.

As the name of the contest is AtCoder Beginner Contest 100, Ringo would be happy if he is given a positive integer that can be divided by $100$
<strong>
exactly
</strong>
$D$times.
</p>

<p>
Find the $N$-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy.

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

5

</div>

<p>
The integers that can be divided by $100$exactly $0$times (that is, not divisible by $100$) are as follows: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, ...

Thus, the $5$-th smallest integer that would make Ringo happy is $5$.

### **Sample Output 2**

<div>

1100

</div>

<p>
The integers that can be divided by $100$exactly once are as follows: $100$, $200$, $300$, $400$, $500$, $600$, $700$, $800$, $900$, $1 \ 000$, $1 \ 100$, ...

Thus, the integer we are seeking is $1 \ 100$.

### **Sample Output 3**

<div>

850000

</div>

<p>
The integers that can be divided by $100$exactly twice are as follows: $10 \ 000$, $20 \ 000$, $30 \ 000$, ...

Thus, the integer we are seeking is $850 \ 000$.
