### **Why Tokio Marine target AtCoder users**

<section>

<p>
Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co.,Ltd. needs AtCoder users.
      
</p>

<p>
About 140 years ago, we were born as the first Non-Life insurance company in Japan.
  We started with marine insurance, which support growth of shipping or trade in Meiji period, followed by auto insurance in motorization, earthquake insurance for large-scale earthquake disasters, and cyber risk insurance for the recent networked society. Non-life insurance has been changing with the progress of times.
  For 140 years since establishment, we have been providing new insurance services for the changing society by quantifying the risks of accidents and disasters based on mathematical models. However, in the current era of technological innovation and digital transformation, we endeavor to transform ourselves more rapidly than ever.
  To build a safe and secure society by utilizing complex data acquired from the latest digital technologies, IoT equipment and human activities, we strongly believe that talents with algorithm design and programing become a key to our success.
  We hope, in the future, participants of this contest will create new businesses or support those challenges by using cutting-edge technologies and complicated data, leading to a safe and secure society.
