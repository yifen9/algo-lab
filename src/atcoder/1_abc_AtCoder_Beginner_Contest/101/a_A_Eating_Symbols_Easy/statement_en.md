### **Problem Statement**

<p>
There is always an integer in Takahashi's mind.
</p>

<p>
Initially, the integer in Takahashi's mind is $0$. Takahashi is now going to eat four symbols, each of which is `+`or `-`. When he eats `+`, the integer in his mind increases by $1$; when he eats `-`, the integer in his mind decreases by $1$.
</p>

<p>
The symbols Takahashi is going to eat are given to you as a string $S$. The $i$-th character in $S$is the $i$-th symbol for him to eat.
</p>

<p>
Find the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

2

</div>

<ul>

<li>
Initially, the integer in Takahashi's mind is $0$.
</li>

<li>
The first integer for him to eat is `+`. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes $1$.
</li>

<li>
The second integer to eat is `-`. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes $0$.
</li>

<li>
The third integer to eat is `+`. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes $1$.
</li>

<li>
The fourth integer to eat is `+`. After eating it, the integer in his mind becomes $2$.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Thus, the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols is $2$.
