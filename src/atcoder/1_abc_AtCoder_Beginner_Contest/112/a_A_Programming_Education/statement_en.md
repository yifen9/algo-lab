### **Problem Statement**

<p>
In $2020$, AtCoder Inc. with an annual sales of more than one billion yen (the currency of Japan) has started a business in programming education.

One day, there was an exam where a one-year-old child must write a program that prints `Hello World`, and a two-year-old child must write a program that receives integers $A, B$and prints $A+B$.

Takahashi, who is taking this exam, suddenly forgets his age.

He decides to write a program that first receives his age $N$($1$or $2$) as input, then prints `Hello World`if $N=1$, and additionally receives integers $A, B$and prints $A+B$if $N=2$.

Write this program for him.
