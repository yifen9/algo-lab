### **Problem Statement**

<p>
There are four types of oysters, labeled $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$. Exactly one of these types causes stomach trouble if eaten. The other types do not cause stomach trouble when eaten.
</p>

<p>
Takahashi ate oysters $1$and $2$, and Aoki ate oysters $1$and $3$. The information on whether each person got sick is given as two strings $S_1$and $S_2$. Specifically, $S_1 =$`sick`means Takahashi got sick, and $S_1 =$`fine`means Takahashi did not get sick. Likewise, $S_2 =$`sick`means Aoki got sick, and $S_2 =$`fine`means Aoki did not get sick.
</p>

<p>
Based on the given information, find which type of oyster causes stomach trouble.
