### **Problem Statement**

<p>
There are three Takahashis numbered $1$, $2$and $3$, and three hats colored red, green, and blue.  Each Takahashi is wearing one hat.  The color of the hat that Takahashi $i$is currently wearing is represented by a character $S_i$.  Here, `R`corresponds to red, `G`to green, and `B`to blue.  Now, they will do the following operation 
<strong>
exactly
</strong>
$10^{18}$times.
</p>

#### **Operation**

<ul>

<li>
Choose two out of the three Takahashis.  The two exchange the hats they are wearing.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Is it possible to make Takahashi $i$wearing the hat of color corresponding to character $T_i$after the $10^{18}$repetitions?
