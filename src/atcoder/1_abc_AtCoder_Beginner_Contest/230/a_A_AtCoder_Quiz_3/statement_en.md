### **Problem Statement**

<p>
AtCoder Grand Contest (AGC), a regularly held contest with a world authority, has been held $54$times.
</p>

<p>
Just like the $230$-th ABC ― the one you are in now ― is called `ABC230`, the $N$-th AGC is initially named with a zero-padded $3$-digit number $N$. (The $1$-st AGC is `AGC001`, the $2$-nd AGC is `AGC002`, ...)
</p>

<p>
However, the latest $54$-th AGC is called `AGC055`, where the number is one greater than $54$. Because `AGC042`is canceled and missing due to the social situation, the $42$-th and subsequent contests are assigned numbers that are one greater than the numbers of contests held. (See also the explanations at Sample Inputs and Outputs.)
</p>

<p>
Here is the problem: given an integer $N$, print the name of the $N$-th AGC in the format `AGCXXX`, where `XXX`is the zero-padded $3$-digit number.

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

AGC043

</div>

<p>
As explained in Problem Statement, the $42$-th and subsequent AGCs are assigned numbers that are one greater than the numbers of contests.

Thus, the $42$-th AGC is named `AGC043`.
