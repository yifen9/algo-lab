### **Contest Rules**
This contest is full-feedback (solutions are judged during the contest).
    

When you solve a problem, you get a score assigned to it.
    Competitors are ranked first by total scores, then by penalties.
    The penalties are computed as (the time you spend to get your current score) + (5 minutes) * (the number of incorrect attempts).
