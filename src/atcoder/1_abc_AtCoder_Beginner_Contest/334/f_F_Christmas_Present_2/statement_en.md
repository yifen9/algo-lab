### **Problem Statement**

<p>
There is a town represented as an $xy$-plane, where Santa lives, along with $N$children numbered $1$to $N$.
Santa's house is at coordinates $(S_X,S_Y)$, and the house of child $i\ (1\leq i\leq N)$is at $(X_i,Y_i)$.
</p>

<p>
Santa wants to deliver one present to each of the $N$children 
<strong>
in numerical order
</strong>
.
To deliver a present to child $i$, Santa must visit the house of child $i$with at least one present in hand.
However, Santa can only carry up to $K$presents at a time, and he must return to his own house to replenish presents (there are enough presents at Santa's house).
</p>

<p>
Find the minimum distance Santa must travel to leave his house, deliver presents to all $N$children, and return to his house.

<p>
In the figure above, the red circle represents Santa's house, and the circles with numbers represent the houses of the children with those numbers.
</p>

<p>
Consider Santa acting as follows:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Leave his house with two presents.
</li>

<li>
Go to child $1$'s house and deliver a present.
</li>

<li>
Return to his house and replenish one present.
</li>

<li>
Go to child $2$'s house and deliver a present.
</li>

<li>
Go to child $3$'s house and deliver a present.
</li>

<li>
Return to his house.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
In this case, Santa travels the distance of $2+2+1+2+\sqrt{5}=7+\sqrt{5}=9.236\dots$, which is the minimum.
