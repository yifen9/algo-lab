### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Two students of AtCoder Kindergarten are fighting over candy packs.
</p>

<p>
There are three candy packs, each of which contains $a$, $b$, and $c$candies, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Teacher Evi is trying to distribute the packs between the two students so that each student gets the same number of candies. Determine whether it is possible.
</p>

<p>
Note that Evi cannot take candies out of the packs, and the whole contents of each pack must be given to one of the students.
