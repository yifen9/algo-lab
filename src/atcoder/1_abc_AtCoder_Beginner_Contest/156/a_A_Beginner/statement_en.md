### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Takahashi is a member of a programming competition site, 
<em>
ButCoder
</em>
.
</p>

<p>
Each member of ButCoder is assigned two values: 
<strong>
Inner Rating
</strong>
and 
<strong>
Displayed Rating
</strong>
.
</p>

<p>
The Displayed Rating of a member is equal to their Inner Rating if the member has participated in $10$or more contests. Otherwise, the Displayed Rating will be their Inner Rating minus $100 \times (10 - K)$when the member has participated in $K$contests.
</p>

<p>
Takahashi has participated in $N$contests, and his Displayed Rating is $R$. Find his Inner Rating.

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

3719

</div>

<p>
Takahashi has participated in $2$contests, which is less than $10$, so his Displayed Rating is his Inner Rating minus $100 \times (10 - 2) = 800$.
</p>

<p>
Thus, Takahashi's Inner Rating is $2919 + 800 = 3719$.
