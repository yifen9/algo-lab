### **Problem Statement**

<p>
AtCoder City will hold a mayoral election. The candidates are Aoki and Takahashi.

The city consists of $N$towns, the $i$-th of which has $A_i$pro-Aoki voters and $B_i$pro-Takahashi voters. There are no other voters.

Takahashi can make a speech in each town.

If he makes a speech in some town, all voters in that town, pro-Takahashi or pro-Aoki, will vote for Takahashi.

On the other hand, if he does not make a speech in some town, the pro-Aoki voters in that town will vote for Aoki, and the pro-Takahashi voters will not vote.

To get more votes than Aoki, in how many towns does Takahashi need to make speeches at least?
