### **Problem Statement**

<p>
A basketball game is being played, and the score is now $X$-$Y$. Here, it is guaranteed that $X \neq Y$.

Can the team which is behind turn the tables with a successful three-point goal?

In other words, if the team which is behind earns three points, will its score become strictly greater than that of the other team?
