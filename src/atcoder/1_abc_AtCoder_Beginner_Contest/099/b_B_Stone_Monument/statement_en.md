### **Problem Statement**

<p>
In some village, there are $999$towers that are $1,(1+2),(1+2+3),...,(1+2+3+...+999)$meters high from west to east, at intervals of $1$meter.
</p>

<p>
It had been snowing for a while before it finally stopped. For some two adjacent towers located $1$meter apart, we measured the lengths of the parts of those towers that are not covered with snow, and the results are $a$meters for the west tower, and $b$meters for the east tower.
</p>

<p>
Assuming that the depth of snow cover and the altitude are the same everywhere in the village, find the amount of the snow cover.
</p>

<p>
Assume also that the depth of the snow cover is always at least $1$meter.

<p>
The heights of the two towers are $10$meters and $15$meters, respectively.
Thus, we can see that the depth of the snow cover is $2$meters.
