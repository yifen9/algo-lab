### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Takahashi has a water bottle with the shape of a rectangular prism whose base is a square of side $a~\mathrm{cm}$and whose height is $b~\mathrm{cm}$. (The thickness of the bottle can be ignored.)
</p>

<p>
We will pour $x~\mathrm{cm}^3$of water into the bottle, and gradually tilt the bottle around one of the sides of the base.
</p>

<p>
When will the water be spilled? More formally, find the maximum angle in which we can tilt the bottle without spilling any water.
