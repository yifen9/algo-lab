### **Problem Statement**

<p>
You have decided to give an allowance to your child depending on the outcome of the game that he will play now.
</p>

<p>
The game is played as follows:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
There are three "integer panels", each with a digit between $1$and $9$(inclusive) printed on it, and one "operator panel" with a `+`printed on it.
</li>

<li>
The player should construct a formula of the form $X + Y$, by arranging the four panels from left to right. (The operator panel should not be placed at either end of the formula.)
</li>

<li>
Then, the amount of the allowance will be equal to the resulting value of the formula.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Given the values $A, B$and $C$printed on the integer panels used in the game, find the maximum possible amount of the allowance.
