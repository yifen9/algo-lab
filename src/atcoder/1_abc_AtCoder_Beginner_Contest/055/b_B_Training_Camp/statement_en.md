### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Snuke loves working out. He is now exercising $N$times.
</p>

Before he starts exercising, his 
<em>
power
</em>
is $1$. After he exercises for the $i$-th time, his power gets multiplied by $i$.
</p>

<p>
Find Snuke's power after he exercises $N$times. Since the answer can be extremely large, print the answer modulo $10^{9}+7$.
