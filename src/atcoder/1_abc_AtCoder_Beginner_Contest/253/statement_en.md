### **Why is NOMURA targeting AtCoder users?**

<section>

<p>
In the world of finance, a new market was once created from a single mathematical formula. That market is now said to be $600 trillion in size. The 1980s saw a large influx of mathematical experts into the field of finance, mainly from the aerospace engineering industry. These experts developed investment strategies and financial products based on mathematical formulas. Nomura believes that having people skilled in mathematical analysis is the key to our competitive edge in the financial services industry. For more than 30 years, we have hired and trained teams comprising mathematical science professionals (Quantitative Analysts, Researchers and Engineers) dedicated to the research and analysis of mathematical models. Using the power of mathematics, we have worked to develop an algorithm that shows the mechanism of global money flows. The next challenge is to unlock the potential of mathematics, statistics and information science to solve real-world problems that go beyond the academic world. Through this competition, we aim to find new talent with exceptional mathematical, statistical or computational skills to create the next $600 trillion market together. AtCoder provides the perfect stage and we invite you all to showcase your extraordinary talent.

<p>
By nature, the analysis of financial markets involves constantly handling data, which makes it highly compatible with IT technology and quantitative analysis, and engineers and researchers are able to leverage their specialized skills in various departments and businesses.
      
</p>

<p>
One example is my work in the Global Markets Digital Strategy Department. To promote the digitalization of trading processes, we plan, design, and develop in-house systems, in addition to developing mathematical models for the pricing of financial products, and analyzing market data in cooperation with our users, experienced traders, sales personnel, and the IT department. Also, there are many opportunities to work with related departments overseas.
      
</p>

<p>
System development can be very challenging in the specialized field of finance as it requires a deep understanding of actual business operations. However, there are many opportunities to learn and come up with creative ideas for mathematical modeling, its implementation, and algorithms for calculation speedup. It is also very rewarding to see it being put to practical use in business. I believe that competitive programmers with strong thinking and coding skills will have many opportunities to excel at Nomura.
      
</p>

<p>
Mathematical and IT technologies are applied to the financial services business for a wide range of purposes and methods. If you are interested in learning more, please feel free to join the briefing session!
