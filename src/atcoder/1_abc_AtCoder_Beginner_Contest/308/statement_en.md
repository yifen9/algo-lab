Hi everybody! My name is Akira Matsuzaki, CTO of e-Seikatsu. (It means “Good Life” in Japanese.)
                We are a vertical B2B SaaS provider to innovate the Japanese real estate market, with the mission of
                “Create society where comfortable life circulates”.
            
</p>

<p>
We’ve given sponsorships of the ICPC Asia Regionals, JOI (Japan Olympiad in Informatics), SuperCon (a
                Japanese HPC competition for high-school students), and other computing competitions and events every
                year in the past.
                Through these activities, we support competitive programming and its participants, as well as the
                students who aim for it.
            
</p>

<p>
I believe that the experience of competitive programming is important and meaningful for the general
                software development.
                Because it’s a very useful place to acquire important skills to develop high-quality and
                high-performance software: consider approaches to solving problems, select best algorithm, assume and
                understand the intentions of the questioners, and of course, the coding skills needed to implement your
                thinking.
                In fact, there are many engineers in our team who did competitive programming when they were students or
                who still love and do it.
            
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, I feel strongly that there are insufficient female programmers and engineers in
                Japan; this is very unfortunate.
                Therefore, we’ve given sponsorships the Women’s Division of the JOI to advance STEM education for women
                in Japan.
                So, when I heard about CodeQUEEN in this context, I decided immediately to sponsor this new initiative.
            
</p>

<p>
I firmly believe that gender should not be a determining factor for individuals aspiring to become
                programmers and engineers.
                We hope that you’ll become interested in the field of competitive programming or software programmers
                and engineers, then will have an opportunity to growth your potential in there through this competition.

<p>
freee has “Empower Small Businesses to Take Center Stage.” as its mission and aims to build an
                integrated management platform that allows everyone the freedom to run their own business. freee keep
                customer’s accounting, human resources, and other business data as a cloud-based ERP and provide
                functions to improve customer’s work efficiency.
            
</p>

<p>
Records of daily transactions and time and attendance gradually become large volumes of data as the
                company grows, it is necessary to be conscious of computational efficiency in order to present
                information by aggregating these in real time. For example, freee currently has over a billion records,
                this number exceeds the 10

</sup>
often seen in AtCoder questions. Of course, processing all the
                elements one
                by one would be time consuming.
            
</p>

<p>
Calculation of taxes and salaries requires the ability to convert the complex specifications of laws
                that
                change year by year into logic and accurately put them into code. In addition, since the system is
                loosely coupled by dividing it into microservices so that the complexity of each domain area does not
                affect the others, data must be efficiently federated while maintaining consistency among the services.

            
</p>

<p>
For these issues, we believe that “Ability to select appropriate data structures and algorithms for the
                problem” and “Ability to implement quickly while considering edge cases” that AtCoder users have will be
                very useful.


            
</p>

<p>
Also, freee believes that in order to realize a society in which anyone can run their business freely,
                it
                is important for freee’s employees themselves to have diverse attributes and backgrounds, and for each
                individual to work naturally.

            
</p>

<p>
freee, which is based on the premise that “Everyone has some kind of minority element.”, is working to
                support and create an environment where diverse people, such as gender, LGBTQ+, people with
                disabilities, and globals, can be active.


            
</p>

<p>
We participated as a sponsor this time because we want AtCoder users to know about freee, and we also
                want to work together with them to develop a society in which diverse people can perform better. We hope
                that this competition will help you to become more interested in engineering and to think about your
                future career.

### **Contest Rules**
This contest is full-feedback (solutions are judged during the contest).
        

When you solve a problem, you get a score assigned to it.
        Competitors are ranked first by total scores, then by penalties.
        The penalties are computed as (the time you spend to get your current score) + (5 minutes) * (the number of
        incorrect attempts).
