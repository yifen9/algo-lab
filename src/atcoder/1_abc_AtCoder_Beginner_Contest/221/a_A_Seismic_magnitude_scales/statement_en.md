### **Problem Statement**

<p>
The magnitude of an earthquake is a logarithmic scale of the energy released by the earthquake. It is known that each time the magnitude increases by $1$, the amount of energy gets multiplied by approximately $32$.

Here, we assume that the amount of energy gets multiplied by exactly $32$each time the magnitude increases by $1$. In this case, how many times is the amount of energy of a magnitude $A$earthquake as much as that of a magnitude $B$earthquake?

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

1024

</div>

<p>
$6$is $2$greater than $4$, so a magnitude $6$earthquake has $32\times 32=1024$times as much energy as a magnitude $4$earthquake has.
