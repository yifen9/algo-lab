### **Problem Statement**

<p>
The coins used in the Kingdom of Takahashi are $1!$-yen coins, $2!$-yen coins, $\dots$, and $10!$-yen coins. Here, $N! = 1 \times 2 \times \dots \times N$.
</p>

<p>
Takahashi has $100$of every kind of coin, and he is going to buy a product worth $P$yen 
<strong>
by giving the exact amount without receiving change
</strong>
.
</p>

<p>
We can prove that there is always such a way to make payment.
</p>

<p>
At least how many coins does he need to use in his payment?
