### **Problem Statement**

<p>
On some day in January $2018$, Takaki is writing a document. The document has a column where the current date is written in `yyyy/mm/dd`format. For example, January $23$, $2018$should be written as `2018/01/23`.
</p>

<p>
After finishing the document, she noticed that she had mistakenly wrote `2017`at the beginning of the date column. Write a program that, when the string that Takaki wrote in the date column, $S$, is given as input, modifies the first four characters in $S$to `2018`and prints it.
