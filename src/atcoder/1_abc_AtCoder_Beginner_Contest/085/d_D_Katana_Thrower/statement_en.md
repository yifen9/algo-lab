### **Problem Statement**

<p>
You are going out for a walk, when you suddenly encounter a monster. Fortunately, you have $N$katana (swords), Katana $1$, Katana $2$, $…$, Katana $N$, and can perform the following two kinds of attacks in any order:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Wield one of the katana you have. When you wield Katana $i$$(1 ≤ i ≤ N)$, the monster receives $a_i$points of damage. The same katana can be wielded any number of times.
</li>

<li>
Throw one of the katana you have. When you throw Katana $i$$(1 ≤ i ≤ N)$at the monster, it receives $b_i$points of damage, and you lose the katana. That is, you can no longer wield or throw that katana.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
The monster will vanish when the total damage it has received is $H$points or more. At least how many attacks do you need in order to vanish it in total?

<p>
You have one katana. Wielding it deals $3$points of damage, and throwing it deals $5$points of damage. By wielding it twice and then throwing it, you will deal $3 + 3 + 5 = 11$points of damage in a total of three attacks, vanishing the monster.
