### **Problem Statement**

<blockquote>

<p>
Among the $81$integers that appear in the $9$-by-$9$multiplication table, find the sum of those that are not $X$.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
There is a grid of size $9$by $9$.

Each cell of the grid contains an integer: the cell at the $i$-th row from the top and the $j$-th column from the left contains $i \times j$.

You are given an integer $X$. Among the $81$integers written in this grid, find the sum of those that are not $X$. If the same value appears in multiple cells, add it for each cell.

### **Sample Output 1**

<div>

2024

</div>

<p>
The only cell with $1$in the grid is the cell at the 1st row from the top and 1st column from the left. Summing all integers that are not $1$yields $2024$.
