### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Takahashi has $N$balls with positive integers written on them. The integer written on the $i$-th ball is $A_i$.
He would like to form some number of pairs such that the sum of the integers written on each pair of balls is a power of $2$.
Note that a ball cannot belong to multiple pairs.
Find the maximum possible number of pairs that can be formed.
</p>

<p>
Here, a positive integer is said to be a power of $2$when it can be written as $2^t$using some non-negative integer $t$.
