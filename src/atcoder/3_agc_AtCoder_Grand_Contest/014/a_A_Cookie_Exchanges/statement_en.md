### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Takahashi, Aoki and Snuke love cookies. They have $A$, $B$and $C$cookies, respectively. Now, they will exchange those cookies by repeating the action below:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Each person simultaneously divides his cookies in half and gives one half to each of the other two persons.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
This action will be repeated until there is a person with odd number of cookies in hand.
</p>

<p>
How many times will they repeat this action?
Note that the answer may not be finite.

<p>
Initially, Takahashi, Aoki and Snuke have $4$, $12$and $20$cookies. Then,
</p>

<ul>

<li>
After the first action, they have $16$, $12$and $8$.
</li>

<li>
After the second action, they have $10$, $12$and $14$.
</li>

<li>
After the third action, they have $13$, $12$and $11$.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Now, Takahashi and Snuke have odd number of cookies, and therefore the answer is $3$.
