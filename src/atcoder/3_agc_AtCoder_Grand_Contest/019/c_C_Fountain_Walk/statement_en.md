### **Problem Statement**

<p>
In the city of Nevermore, there are $10^8$streets and $10^8$avenues, both numbered from $0$to $10^8-1$.
All streets run straight from west to east, and all avenues run straight from south to north.
The distance between neighboring streets and between neighboring avenues is exactly $100$meters.
</p>

<p>
Every street intersects every avenue. Every intersection can be described by pair $(x, y)$, where $x$is avenue ID and $y$is street ID.
</p>

<p>
There are $N$fountains in the city, situated at intersections $(X_i, Y_i)$.
Unlike normal intersections, there's a circle with radius $10$meters centered at the intersection, and there are no road parts inside this circle.
</p>

<p>
The picture below shows an example of how a part of the city with roads and fountains may look like.

<p>
City governors don't like encountering more than one fountain while moving along the same road.
Therefore, every street contains at most one fountain on it, as well as every avenue.
</p>

<p>
Citizens can move along streets, avenues and fountain perimeters.
What is the shortest distance one needs to cover in order to get from intersection $(x_1, y_1)$to intersection $(x_2, y_2)$?
