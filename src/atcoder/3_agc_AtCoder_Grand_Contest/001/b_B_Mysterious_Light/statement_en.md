### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of 
<em>
Mysterious Light
</em>
.
</p>

<p>
Three mirrors of length $N$are set so that they form an equilateral triangle.
Let the vertices of the triangle be $a, b$and $c$.
</p>

<p>
Inside the triangle, the rifle is placed at the point $p$on segment $ab$such that $ap = X$.
(The size of the rifle is negligible.)
Now, the rifle is about to fire a ray of Mysterious Light in the direction of $bc$.
</p>

<p>
The ray of Mysterious Light will travel in a straight line, and will be reflected by mirrors, in the same ways as "ordinary" light.
There is one major difference, though: it will be also reflected by its own trajectory as if it is a mirror!
When the ray comes back to the rifle, the ray will be absorbed.
</p>

<p>
The following image shows the ray's trajectory where $N = 5$and $X = 2$.

</div>

<p>
It can be shown that the ray eventually comes back to the rifle and is absorbed, regardless of the values of $N$and $X$.
Find the total length of the ray's trajectory.
