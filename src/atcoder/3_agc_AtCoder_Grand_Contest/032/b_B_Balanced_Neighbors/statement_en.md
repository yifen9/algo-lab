### **Problem Statement**

<p>
You are given an integer $N$.
Build an undirected graph with $N$vertices with indices $1$to $N$that satisfies the following two conditions:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The graph is simple and connected.
</li>

<li>
There exists an integer $S$such that, for every vertex, the sum of the indices of the vertices adjacent to that vertex is $S$.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
It can be proved that at least one such graph exists under the constraints of this problem.

### **Output**

<p>
In the first line, print the number of edges, $M$, in the graph you made. In the $i$-th of the following $M$lines, print two integers $a_i$and $b_i$, representing the endpoints of the $i$-th edge.
</p>

<p>
The output will be judged correct if the graph satisfies the conditions.
