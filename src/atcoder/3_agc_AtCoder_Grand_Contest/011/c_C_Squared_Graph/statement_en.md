### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Takahashi has received an undirected graph with $N$vertices, numbered $1$, $2$, ..., $N$.
The edges in this graph are represented by $(u_i, v_i)$.
There are no self-loops and multiple edges in this graph.
</p>

<p>
Based on this graph, Takahashi is now constructing a new graph with $N^2$vertices, where each vertex is labeled with a pair of integers $(a, b)$($1 \leq a \leq N$, $1 \leq b \leq N$).
The edges in this new graph are generated by the following rule:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Span an edge between vertices $(a, b)$and $(a', b')$if and only if both of the following two edges exist in the original graph: an edge between vertices $a$and $a'$, and an edge between vertices $b$and $b'$.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
How many connected components are there in this new graph?
