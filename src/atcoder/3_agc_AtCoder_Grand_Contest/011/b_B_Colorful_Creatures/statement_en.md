### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Snuke found $N$strange creatures.
Each creature has a fixed color and size. The color and size of the $i$-th creature are represented by $i$and $A_i$, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Every creature can absorb another creature whose size is at most twice the size of itself.
When a creature of size $A$and color $B$absorbs another creature of size $C$and color $D$($C \leq 2 \times A$), they will merge into one creature of size $A+C$and color $B$.
Here, depending on the sizes of two creatures, it is possible that both of them can absorb the other.
</p>

<p>
Snuke has been watching these creatures merge over and over and ultimately become one creature.
Find the number of the possible colors of this creature.

<p>
The possible colors of the last remaining creature are colors $1$and $3$.
For example, when the creature of color $3$absorbs the creature of color $2$, then the creature of color $1$absorbs the creature of color $3$, the color of the last remaining creature will be color $1$.
