### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Takahashi Lake has a perimeter of $L$. On the circumference of the lake, there is a residence of the lake's owner, Takahashi.
Each point on the circumference of the lake has a coordinate between $0$and $L$(including $0$but not $L$), which is the distance from the Takahashi's residence, measured counter-clockwise.
</p>

<p>
There are $N$trees around the lake; the coordinate of the $i$-th tree is $X_i$. There is no tree at coordinate $0$, the location of Takahashi's residence.
</p>

<p>
Starting at his residence, Takahashi will repeat the following action:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
If all trees are burnt, terminate the process.
</li>

<li>
Specify a direction: clockwise or counter-clockwise.
</li>

<li>
Walk around the lake in the specified direction, until the coordinate of a tree that is not yet burnt is reached for the first time.
</li>

<li>
When the coordinate with the tree is reached, burn that tree, stay at the position and go back to the first step.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Find the longest possible total distance Takahashi walks during the process.
