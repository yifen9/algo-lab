### **Problem Statement**

<p>
There are $M$chairs arranged in a line. The coordinate of the $i$-th chair $(1 ≤ i ≤ M)$is $i$.
</p>

<p>
$N$people of the Takahashi clan played too much games, and they are all suffering from backaches. They need to sit in chairs and rest, but they are particular about which chairs they sit in. Specifically, the $i$-th person wishes to sit in a chair whose coordinate is not greater than $L_i$, or not less than $R_i$. Naturally, only one person can sit in the same chair.
</p>

<p>
It may not be possible for all of them to sit in their favorite chairs, if nothing is done.
Aoki, who cares for the health of the people of the Takahashi clan, decides to provide additional chairs so that all of them can sit in chairs at their favorite positions.
</p>

<p>
Additional chairs can be placed at arbitrary real coordinates. Find the minimum required number of additional chairs.
