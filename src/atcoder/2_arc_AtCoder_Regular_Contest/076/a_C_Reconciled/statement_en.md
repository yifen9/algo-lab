### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Snuke has $N$dogs and $M$monkeys. He wants them to line up in a row.
</p>

<p>
As a Japanese saying goes, these dogs and monkeys are on bad terms. 
<em>
("ken'en no naka", literally "the relationship of dogs and monkeys", means a relationship of mutual hatred.)
</em>
Snuke is trying to reconsile them, by arranging the animals so that there are neither two adjacent dogs nor two adjacent monkeys.
</p>

<p>
How many such arrangements there are? Find the count modulo $10^9+7$(since animals cannot understand numbers larger than that).
Here, dogs and monkeys are both distinguishable. Also, two arrangements that result from reversing each other are distinguished.
