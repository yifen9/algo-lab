<p>
Note: This ARC also serves as a qualification round to select the 18 contestants for the Japanese national finals, making it significantly more difficult than a regular ARC. 

<font color="red">Due to circumstances, we replaced the tasks and changed the point values. Since there are no easy tasks, the difficulty level of solving one or more tasks has increased. Please be careful. Since the difficulty level is flat, we recommend reading all the tasks and not necessarily solving them in order.</font>

### **Contest Rules**
This contest is full-feedback (solutions are judged during the contest).
    

When you solve a problem, you get a score assigned to it.
    Competitors are ranked first by total scores, then by penalties.
    The penalties are computed as (the time you spend to get your current score) + (5 minutes) * (the number of incorrect attempts).
