### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Let $N$be an even number.
</p>

<p>
There is a tree with $N$vertices.
The vertices are numbered $1, 2, ..., N$.
For each $i$($1 \leq i \leq N - 1$), the $i$-th edge connects Vertex $x_i$and $y_i$.
</p>

<p>
Snuke would like to decorate the tree with ribbons, as follows.
</p>

<p>
First, he will divide the $N$vertices into $N / 2$pairs.
Here, each vertex must belong to exactly one pair.
Then, for each pair $(u, v)$, put a ribbon through all the edges contained in the shortest path between $u$and $v$.
</p>

<p>
Snuke is trying to divide the vertices into pairs so that the following condition is satisfied: "for every edge, there is at least one ribbon going through it."
How many ways are there to divide the vertices into pairs, satisfying this condition?
Find the count modulo $10^9 + 7$.
Here, two ways to divide the vertices into pairs are considered different when there is a pair that is contained in one of the two ways but not in the other.
