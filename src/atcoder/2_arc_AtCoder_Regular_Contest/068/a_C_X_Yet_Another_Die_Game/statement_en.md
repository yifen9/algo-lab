### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Snuke has decided to play with a six-sided die. Each of its six sides shows an integer $1$through $6$, and two numbers on opposite sides always add up to $7$.
</p>

<p>
Snuke will first put the die on the table with an arbitrary side facing upward, then repeatedly perform the following operation:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Operation: Rotate the die $90°$toward one of the following directions: left, right, front (the die will come closer) and back (the die will go farther). Then, obtain $y$points where $y$is the number written in the side facing upward.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
For example, let us consider the situation where the side showing $1$faces upward, the near side shows $5$and the right side shows $4$, as illustrated in the figure.
If the die is rotated toward the right as shown in the figure, the side showing $3$will face upward.
Besides, the side showing $4$will face upward if the die is rotated toward the left, the side showing $2$will face upward if the die is rotated toward the front, and the side showing $5$will face upward if the die is rotated toward the back.
