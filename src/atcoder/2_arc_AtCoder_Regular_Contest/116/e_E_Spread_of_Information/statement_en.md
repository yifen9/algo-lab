### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Takahashi Kingdom has $N$towns, called Town $1$through $N$.
There are $N-1$roads in this kingdom. The $i$-th road connects Town $u_i$and Town $v_i$bidirectionally. For any two towns $a$and $b$, it is possible to get from Town $a$to Town $b$by traversing some roads.
</p>

<p>
Takahashi, the king, wants to spread some information all over the kingdom. Since he is busy, he can directly transmit this information to at most $K$towns.
</p>

<p>
Assume that Takahashi finishes transmitting the information at time $0$. Then, for each $t = 1, 2, 3, \cdots$, the following happens:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
For towns $a$and $b$directly connected by a road, if $a$has already received the information at time $t - 0.5$but $b$has not, $b$receives it at time $t$.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Takahashi wants to choose the $K$towns to transmit the information to minimize the time taken until every town receives it. Find the minimum time this takes.

<p>
If Takahashi directly transmits the information to Town $2$and $4$, Town $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$receives it at time $1, 0, 1, 0, 1$, respectively.
In this case, the information is spread all over the kingdom at time $1$. We can prove that this is the earliest possible time.
