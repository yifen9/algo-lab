<p>
This is the first ARC after the change of admin. (See <a href="https://atcoder.jp/posts/1281">details</a>)
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The criteria for scoring have been revised.
</li>

<li>
The difficulty of the later problems is lower than before.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
However, due to special circumstances, the difficulty of the earlier problems has significantly increased compared to the standard difficulty target for ARC under the new admin.

<span>
In the future, the earlier problems in ARC are expected to be easier than this one.
</span>

</p>

<p>
Given the even distribution of difficulty, we recommend reading all problems rather than focusing solely on solving them in order.

### **Contest Rules**
This contest is full-feedback (solutions are judged during the contest).
    

When you solve a problem, you get a score assigned to it.
    Competitors are ranked first by total scores, then by penalties.
    The penalties are computed as (the time you spend to get your current score) + (5 minutes) * (the number of incorrect attempts).
