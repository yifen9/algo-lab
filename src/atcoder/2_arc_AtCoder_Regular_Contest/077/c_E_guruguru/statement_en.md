### **Problem Statement**

<p>
Snuke is buying a lamp.
The light of the lamp can be adjusted to $m$levels of brightness, represented by integers from $1$through $m$, by the two buttons on the remote control.
</p>

<p>
The first button is a "forward" button. When this button is pressed, the brightness level is increased by $1$, except when the brightness level is $m$, in which case the brightness level becomes $1$.
</p>

<p>
The second button is a "favorite" button. When this button is pressed, the brightness level becomes the favorite brightness level $x$, which is set when the lamp is purchased.
</p>

<p>
Snuke is thinking of setting the favorite brightness level $x$so that he can efficiently adjust the brightness.
He is planning to change the brightness $n-1$times. In the $i$-th change, the brightness level is changed from $a_i$to $a_{i+1}$. The initial brightness level is $a_1$.
Find the number of times Snuke needs to press the buttons when $x$is set to minimize this number.

### **Sample Output 1**

<p>
When the favorite brightness level is set to $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$and $6$, Snuke needs to press the buttons $8$, $9$, $7$, $5$, $6$and $9$times, respectively.
Thus, Snuke should set the favorite brightness level to $4$.
In this case, the brightness is adjusted as follows:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
In the first change, press the favorite button once, then press the forward button once.
</li>

<li>
In the second change, press the forward button twice.
</li>

<li>
In the third change, press the favorite button once.
</li>

</ul>
