### **Problem Statement**

<p>
There is a kangaroo at coordinate $0$on an infinite number line that runs from left to right, at time $0$.
During the period between time $i-1$and time $i$, the kangaroo can either stay at his position, or perform a jump of length exactly $i$to the left or to the right.
That is, if his coordinate at time $i-1$is $x$, he can be at coordinate $x-i$, $x$or $x+i$at time $i$.
The kangaroo's nest is at coordinate $X$, and he wants to travel to coordinate $X$as fast as possible.
Find the earliest possible time to reach coordinate $X$.
