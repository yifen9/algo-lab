Welcome to AtCoder Regular Contest 058!








This contest is full-feedback (solutions are judged during the contest).




When you solve a problem, you get a score assigned to it.
Competitors are ranked first by total scores, then by penalties.
The penalties are computed as (the time you spend to get your current score) + (5 minutes) * (the number of incorrect attempts).

If you want to practice the usage, please go to <a href="https://practice.contest.atcoder.jp/">https://practice.contest.atcoder.jp/</a>
