### **Contest Rules**
This contest is full-feedback (solutions are judged during the contest).
        

When you solve a problem, you get a score assigned to it.
        Competitors are ranked first by total scores, then by penalties.
        The penalties are computed as (the time you spend to get your current score) + (5 minutes) * (the
        number of
        incorrect attempts).
